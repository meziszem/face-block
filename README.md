# Face Block

This is a modified project I made in the [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/coding-bootcamp/) course.

Using Clarifai's AI face detection program, I made an app that will block any faces in an image.

# Getting Started with Face Block

1: Register yourself using a name, email and password.
2: On the home page, you will see a url box, which you can fill with an image link. Use images that end with a png or jpg like this: https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:853/1*gvcB5wlFg8gSOVjRkwFsxQ.jpeg
3: Press 'Block'
4: Blocked!

# Under Construction
This app is under construction so please excuse any bugs or errors. Feel free to reach out if you come across any issues as I will be updating this with different features in the future.
